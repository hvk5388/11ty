        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>Hey coders! Welcome back to Kern Designs, Hannah here, and as you already know because you found your way to the site, we are exploring 11ty today.</p>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>To begin <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> is a static site generator to make building a website easier. This means that it combines templates and data to create an HTML site. It doesnt include the front-end library of posting. Instead an 11ty user has to utilize a markdown and HTML, which it will then display. It claims to be beginner friendly, but like any other tool there is a learning curve. At least for me, it required a lot of googling and troubleshooting.</p>
<h2>Getting stated in 11ty</h2>
<p>To get started, there are a lot of very helpful articles and how to videos to create a site with 11ty. You can find a culmination of them on the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/tutorials/">11ty site</a> which is how I found one by <a href="https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/build-a-blog/">Filament Group blog</a>. It gives step by step instructions on how to install, run, and create a site.</p>
<h2>Hosting a site</h2>
<p>Because 11ty doesn't host, you need to utilize another source like <a href="https://reclaimhosting.com/">reclaim hosting</a>, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>, or <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">netlify</a>. I personally chose Github pages, but they are all great options.</p>
